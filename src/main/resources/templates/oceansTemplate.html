            <img src="images/southernocean.jpg" class= "ocean">

            <p>Southern Ocean, also called Antarctic Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-sixteenth of
                Earth's total ocean area. The Southern Ocean is made up of the portions of the world ocean south of the
                Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans and their tributary seas surrounding Antarctica below 60Â° S. It is
                unbroken by any other continental landmass. Its narrowest constriction is the Drake Passage, 600 miles
                (about 1,000 km) wide, between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. In terms of area,
                only the Arctic Ocean is smaller.</p>

            <h3>Atlantic Ocean</h3>
            <img src="images/atlanticocean.jpg" class= "ocean">

            <p>The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's five oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2 (41,100,000 sq mi).[2][3] It covers approximately 20% of Earth's surface and about 29% of its water surface area. It is known to separate the "Old World" of Africa, Europe and Asia from the "New World" of the Americas in the European perception of the World.</p>

            <img src="images/pacificocean.jpg" class= "ocean">


            <p>The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.</p>

            <h3>Indian Ocean</h3>


            <p>The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, covering 70,560,000 km2 (27,240,000 sq mi) or 19.8% of the water on Earth's surface.[5] It is bounded by Asia to the north, Africa to the west and Australia to the east. To the south it is bounded by the Southern Ocean or Antarctica, depending on the definition in use.[6] Along its core, the Indian Ocean has some large marginal or regional seas such as the Arabian Sea, the Laccadive Sea, the Somali Sea, Bay of Bengal, and the Andaman Sea.</p>
